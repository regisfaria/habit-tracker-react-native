## Overview

This is the mobile version of my Habit tracker app!

You can check the code also for the server and frontend web!

## Installation & Running

You will need nodejs LTS version and npm, also expo installed on your phone(or IOS/Android emulators).

Simply run `> npm i`

Now you're ready to start! Run the APP with: `> npm run dev`

You will notice that expo terminal will pop up, you can either scan the QR code with your phone, or setup emulators.
